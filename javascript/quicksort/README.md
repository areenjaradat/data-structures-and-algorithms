# Merge Sort

trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Challenge

Write a blog post stepping through the quick sort algorithm
Code is working, tested implementation of quick sort based on the provided pseudocode that takes in an array and returns the same array sorted.

## Approach & Efficiency

Stepped through the algorithm step by step visually and then using the provided pseudocode to implement working code O(n log n) time / O(n log n) space
