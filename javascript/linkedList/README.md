# Singly Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## Challenge

1. create node class has properties (value,next)
2. create linkedList class has head property and methods:

* insert method take a value and add node to the head
* include method take a value and check if it in the linked list
* toString format  the value to be {a}->{b}->NULL

## Approach & Efficiency

* create node class has two properties (value & next pointer to point to the next node by default it's null)
* create linkedList class has property (head) and methods
  * insert method that insert node to the beginning of list
  * include method that search for value if exist in linkedlist
  * toString format  the value to be {a}->{b}->NULL
